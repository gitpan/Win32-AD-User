Win32/AD/User version 0.02
==========================

Win32::AD::User will connect to an Active Directory (AD) Server and
Administer Users. Information on each of the various functions of an 
AD User object can be found here:
  http://www.uni.edu/~prefect/devel/ad-user/index.html

This module was designed to create a useful set of AD User 
administration tools.

This module has been tested and works on a Win2000 Domain Controller.
I would be intrested to hear how this works with various AD configs.

If you are using this module in Windows (which is what it is designed
for) you will want to download and install Nmake 1.5 from Microsoft.
This is available from Microsoft here:
  http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe

If you have problems extracting the files in Windows you will either
want to find a free decompression program like FilZip found here:
  http://www.filzip.com/ 
or check out the GNU utilities for Win32 found here:
  http://www.wzw.tu-muenchen.de/~syring/win32/UnxUtils.html
